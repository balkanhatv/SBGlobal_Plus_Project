# SBGlobal Plus — Canonical Development Branch

**Checkpoint:** `DEV-DB-CURRENT-STATE-AUDITED-001`  
**Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

**Current status:** Foundation PASS · Architecture PASS · Detailed Design COMPLETE/PASS · Development started in the Database phase · current Database persistence and exact-commit CI **VERIFIED**. Earlier readiness evidence authorized Development to start; it does not prove the current database implementation complete.

The physical pre-development ZIP was waived by explicit owner direction under `UD-BACKUP-01`. This session does not claim that a ZIP was created. Any desired local clone/archive backup will be handled manually by the owner.

> **SBGlobal Plus — A World-Class, AI-Ready, AI-Extensible, AI-Powered, Enterprise-Grade, Multi-Tenant, Multi-Industry SaaS Platform.**
>
> **One Unified Enterprise Core → Multiple Equal First-Class Industry Suites → Tenants → Primary + Enabled Industries → Management Systems → Secure Web/Mobile/Desktop Experiences → AI-Powered Operations.**

## Revalidated design and Database checkpoint
- Product/design P0/P1: 0/0
- REAL_DD_GAP: 0
- 9/9 Current Supported Industries: PASS
- 41/41 Management Systems: PASS
- 165/165 named KPI/report metrics: mapped
- Development determinism: 9/9 YES
- QA determinism: 9/9 YES
- Tenant + Industry Context isolation: design + current SQL persistence checks verified; application security validation remains future
- RawSourceCorpus: immutable / PASS

## Core product rules
- Exactly two logical Tenant mobile apps: Tenant Staff App + Tenant User App.
- RBAC is primary; ABAC only narrows/contextualizes.
- `industryContextId = null` never means all industries.
- Future Industry Framework is separate from the current nine and promotion-gated.
- One Unified Enterprise Core; no per-industry core forks.

PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Delivery
Draft PR #2 remains review-only. `main` has not been changed by this continuation.

## Next
Continue Development with the DD-02/DD-03 identity and Tenant/Industry context service slice, then DD-04/DD-06 guard integration; retain database CI and the no-main-merge restriction. Application/API/UI work has not started in this audit.
