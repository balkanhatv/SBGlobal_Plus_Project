**Current executable audit basis:** `4dd7138e5a546f608fe5e28e0912d17523e33693` / tree `33ea828f05b2b8014b4c75401822cde89aa3ee70`

> **Current audit gate (2026-09-28):** complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. DD-209 canonical promotion is exact-head verified; the next governed source audit is authorized. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.


DD-209 re-evaluates only supplied IndustryAIConfig → supplied same-Tenant TenantAIConfig enabled/capability/provider/model non-widening. It does not select current/latest configs, reconstruct historical write-time selection, merge effective configuration, route or execute AI.

Verified canonical DD-209 promotion `f5da3d09c8d63256050f6a204f28240dac3e7e60` / tree `dbd4c2383367e11817b2ce2ed40b3cfd285949c7`: **749/749 Core**, **512/512 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36395275928` (jobs `108840061467`, `108840061324`), Database `36395275730` (job `108840060654`), Web `36395275849` (job `108840060940`).

DD-209 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted and the promotion HEAD is exact-head verified. This state-closure commit must pass its own Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web gate before another DD/source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD209_VERIFICATION_2026-09-28.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: after this DD-209 state-closure HEAD passes exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web, source-audit the next independent AI-configuration relationship. Effective AI configuration and AI execution remain locked.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.
