# D-CHECKPOINT
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-MEDIA-REQUEST-CAPABILITY-BINDING-FLOORS-001`
**Updated:** 2026-09-26 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

DD-202 implements only AIMediaRequest → AICapability exact capability-code foreign-key continuity. Capability currentness/entitlement, principal currentness, PromptTemplate/input-document authorization, provider/model routing, moderation and AI execution remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified DD-202 implementation basis `6e78feb68ce097f004e611cf748f92447a48c0c3` / tree `10ab2fe7617f34aceec800deb998118e22ac80ff`: **657/657 Core**, **504/504 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36233545027` (jobs `108381077064`, `108381077014`), Database `36233544984` (job `108381076802`), Web `36233545017` (job `108381076835`).

DD-202 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted in the current metadata change. The verified executable basis is the implementation HEAD above; this promotion HEAD must independently pass Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web before another DD/source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD202_VERIFICATION_2026-09-26.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this DD-202 canonical promotion HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Only after PASS, source-audit the next independent persisted AI relationship; principal currentness, routing and AI execution remain locked.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.
