# DD-31 — FINAL DEVELOPMENT & QA DETERMINISM AUDIT — PHASE 3
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-PROVISIONING-VERSION-RAW-READ-001`  
**Current executable audit basis:** `4dd7138e5a546f608fe5e28e0912d17523e33693` / tree `33ea828f05b2b8014b4c75401822cde89aa3ee70`  
> **Current audit gate (2026-09-28):** complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. DD-216 canonical promotion is exact-head verified; this state-closure commit must independently pass before DD-217 source audit opens. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.
**Historical status:** PHASE-3 DEVELOPMENT/QA DETERMINISM EVIDENCE · **Date:** 2026-09-13 · **Evaluated substantive HEAD:** `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`

> The 9/9 Development/QA determinism result and final PASS below are preserved as evaluated-era Phase-3 evidence. Governed Development subsequently advanced through DD-208. The complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit is **CLEAN / CLOSED**, DD-209 source audit is authorized, and this file does not define the active project gate.

Question A: can Development implement representative behavior without inventing material product/business rules?  
Question B: can QA test it without inventing expected behavior?

| Industry | Representative flow | Development | QA |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Healthcare | Visit/Order → Sample/Exam/Dispense → Result/Report | YES | YES |
| Education | Exam → Marks → Moderation → Publication → Correction | YES | YES |
| Retail | Sale → Payment → Stock → Refund → Reconciliation | YES | YES |
| Hospitality | Reservation → Check-in → Folio/Night Audit → Checkout | YES | YES |
| Manufacturing | Production Order → Material → Execution → QC → Stock/Closure | YES | YES |
| Professional Services | Project → Allocation → Timesheet → Milestone/Billing | YES | YES |
| Government | Application/Request → Verification/SLA → Approval/Permit → Appeal | YES | YES |
| NGO / Temple / Trust | Donation/Pledge → Fund Allocation → Receipt/Certificate | YES | YES |
| Security / Facility | Shift → Attendance → Patrol/Checkpoint → Incident/Escalation | YES | YES |

## Cross-cutting Phase-3 determinism
- Shared definition lifecycle and safe expression boundary: deterministic.
- Country/localization-pack schema and activation: deterministic.
- AI provisioning/API/memory/prompt/media contracts: deterministic.
- exactly-two Tenant app classes and route manifests: deterministic.
- brand override/protected-token rules: deterministic.
- data access/export/portability contract: deterministic.
- Future Industry promotion states and live-activation gate: deterministic.
- 41-MS acceptance/workflow/KPI evidence remains intact.
- Tenant + Industry Context isolation remains fail-closed.

**Development determinism: 9/9 YES.**  
**QA determinism: 9/9 YES.**  
Material NO: **0**.

**DETERMINISM FINAL AUDIT — PASS.**
