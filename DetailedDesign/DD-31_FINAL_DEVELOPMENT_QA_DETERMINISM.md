# DD-31 — FINAL DEVELOPMENT & QA DETERMINISM AUDIT — PHASE 3
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-DOCUMENT-DERIVATIVE-PARENT-ACL-CURRENT-EFFECT-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `06c99d9b5b48b522b7788dac6a0a260d51a8c48b` / tree `f463c2608eca4a85c557e5f3f5db177d9c00cefb`
> **Current audit gate (2026-10-06):** DD-588…DD-592 canonical promotion passed exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web at the basis above. This state-closure commit must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.
**Historical status:** PHASE-3 DEVELOPMENT/QA DETERMINISM EVIDENCE · **Date:** 2026-09-13 · **Evaluated substantive HEAD:** `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`

> **Historical project overlay (2026-09-28):** this file is preserved as evaluated-era Detailed Design evidence and does not define the active project gate. DD-225…DD-230 implementation is exact-head verified and canonical promotion is exact-head verified; state closure is staged. The complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED**. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Question A: can Development implement representative behavior without inventing material product/business rules?  
Question B: can QA test it without inventing expected behavior?

| Industry | Representative flow | Development | QA |
|---|---|---:|---:|

## Cross-cutting Phase-3 determinism
- Shared definition lifecycle and safe expression boundary: deterministic.
- Country/localization-pack schema and activation: deterministic.
- AI provisioning/API/memory/prompt/media contracts: deterministic.
- exactly-two Tenant app classes and route manifests: deterministic.
- brand override/protected-token rules: deterministic.
- data access/export/portability contract: deterministic.
- Future Industry promotion states and live-activation gate: deterministic.
- 41-MS acceptance/workflow/KPI evidence remains intact.
- Tenant + Industry Context isolation remains fail-closed.

**Development determinism: 9/9 YES.**  
**QA determinism: 9/9 YES.**  
Material NO: **0**.

**DETERMINISM FINAL AUDIT — PASS.**
