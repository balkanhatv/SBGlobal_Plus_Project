## Orphan check
Wave-1 contracts without upstream owner: **0**.  
Upstream Wave-1 dependency-spine concerns without DD owner: **0**.

## Correctly deferred
AI/RAG exact contracts → DD-09 Wave 2.  
Application shells/screens → DD-10 Wave 2.  
Mobile/offline exact client design → DD-11 Wave 2.  
Desktop exact capability/package design → DD-12 Wave 2.  
Industry/MS entity/workflow/API/screen design → DD-13 Wave 3.  
Infrastructure/vendor topology → DD-14 Wave 2.  
Extended security/compliance control implementation → DD-16 Wave 2.  
These are not claimed complete by Wave 1.

## Wave-2 orphan check
Wave-2 contracts without Foundation/Architecture/ADR and Wave-1 dependency owner: **0**.  
Wave-2 authorized scope concerns without a DD owner: **0**.

## Wave-3 boundary
All 41 Management-System-specific entities, workflows, permissions, reports, screens, domain integrations and industry AI tools remain owned by future DD-13 Wave 3. Wave 2 defines only reusable platform contracts.


## Wave-3 Management-System traceability
**Chain:** Foundation → A-09/relevant A-doc → ADR-012 + applicable shared ADR → DD Wave 1 → DD Wave 2 → DD-13/MS artifact.

## Full DD ownership audit
- Foundation requirements requiring Detailed Design with no owner: **0 identified**.
- Architecture decisions requiring Detailed Design with no implementation contract: **0 identified**.
- Wave-1 orphan required contracts: **0**.
- Wave-2 orphan required contracts: **0**.
- Wave-3 Management Systems without DD owner: **0/41**.
- Orphan required DD contracts: **0**.

External jurisdiction/contract/provider facts remain configuration inputs only where DD-REVIEW_REQUIRED states the design abstraction is complete.


## Fable 5 requirement-ID evidence authority
The prior document/section-level Wave-3 table is historical convenience, not sufficient certification proof by itself. Current requirement-level evidence is:
1. `Registers/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX_UNIT.md` — 372 parent/source-heading inventory only.
2. `Registers/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX_REQUIREMENTS.md` — immutable-source child evidence.
3. `Registers/TRACEABILITY_REQUIREMENTS_REVALIDATION_F5.md` — fresh source-fidelity classifications.
4. `Registers/F5_PARTIAL_REQUIREMENT_CLOSURE.md` — 179 PARTIAL-row dispositions.
5. `Registers/F5_DEFERRED_REQUIREMENT_DISPOSITION.md` — 396 historical DEFERRED-row current dispositions.
6. `Registers/F5_USER_DIRECTED_REQUIREMENTS.md` — 328 stable current explicit-user requirement IDs for 41 MS × 8 material DD dimensions.
7. `Registers/DD_REQUIREMENT_TRACEABILITY_F5.md` — exact Source/User Requirement → Foundation → Architecture → ADR → Shared DD → MS DD → Acceptance/Test chains.

### Current chain result
- 41/41 MS have exact current-user material requirement chains.
- 328/328 current-user MS requirement IDs have DD and acceptance owners.
- Source child evidence duplicates are treated as provenance aliases, not unique coverage inflation.
- Broad/partial source destinations are not used alone as certification proof.
- Development/Test-only executable validation requirements remain deferred to their correct future phase.
- Fresh final audits DD-20C/DD-20D and DD-30 passed; current required-contract orphan count is 0 and REAL_GAP=0.
