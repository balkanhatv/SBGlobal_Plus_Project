# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Updated:** 2026-09-21 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-21

Current checkpoint: `DEV-API-REST-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-080. Historical Phase-3 completion applies to its evaluated scope.

Verified executable `ce4708eec15f6b0a35ae9a77d13505221fe55d51` / tree `9655553773e2b1f63ba1e36a479ef3d574ec6077`: **290/290 Core**, **65/65 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files bootstrap**, **Next.js 15.5.25 build** and **Database Verify PASS**. Zero failed/skipped tests. Verified executable inventory: **409 blobs / 161 Markdown / 83 source / 63 test files**.

DD-080 adds an unmounted reusable external REST Fetch adapter: edge and credential/context checks precede body/input work, routes bind one OperationContract, the shared executor remains the only business/security pipeline, and DD-052 owns every success/error/control projection. No route, API-key syntax, OpenAPI document, webhook endpoint, database object or Commercial rule was invented.

Concrete external credential syntax, public REST route catalog/input mappings, OpenAPI publication, webhook transport, broad Core/Industry APIs, product UI/mobile/desktop and production operations remain unfinished. The concrete DD-076 evaluator and its named Commercial policy/evidence producers remain blocked.

Next: concrete REST exposure remains blocked on an exact external credential scheme and public route catalog; the DD-076 evaluator remains blocked on its named policy/evidence definitions. Source-audit another independent source-complete item before implementation and retain exact-head CI/repository invariants.
