# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-INDUSTRY-CONTEXT-ACTIVATION-RAW-READ-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `4dd7138e5a546f608fe5e28e0912d17523e33693` / tree `33ea828f05b2b8014b4c75401822cde89aa3ee70`
**Updated:** 2026-09-28 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **Current audit gate (2026-09-28):** complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. DD-214 canonical promotion is exact-head verified; this state-closure commit must independently pass before DD-215 source audit opens. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.


DD-214 adds only an exact `(tenantId, industryContextId)` raw IndustryContext activation evidence reader returning id/Tenant/raw status/exact bigint activationVersion through the existing SELECT-only context-bootstrap boundary. Snapshot activation-version equality and all authorization/runtime semantics remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified canonical DD-214 promotion `8afc9d34117d777628360ce7e88d531da51e3443` / tree `4715efc674357346aa6bd3c8713f12fe63d7aa9e`: **781/781 Core**, **518/518 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36409410730` (jobs `108885800562`, `108885800269`), Database `36409410779` (job `108885800353`), Web `36409410947` (job `108885800865`).

DD-214 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted and the promotion HEAD is exact-head verified. This state-closure commit must pass its own Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web gate before DD-215 source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD214_VERIFICATION_2026-09-28.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: after this DD-214 state-closure HEAD passes exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web, source-audit ProvisioningSnapshot Industry-scoped activation-version equality using the verified exact-tuple raw IndustryContext activation evidence reader. Effective provisioning, routing and AI execution remain locked.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

## Historical phase records

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Updated:** 2026-09-21 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.
