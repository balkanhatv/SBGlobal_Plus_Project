# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-CONVERSATION-ASSISTANT-REFERENCES-CURRENT-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `69e3b75b978b240373d01c7609efa7cd2c76726d` / tree `65ddf39cd37cad76d4ed9a313b71cd72afd12e8f`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-09):** DD-698…DD-702 implementation independently passed exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web at `69e3b75b978b240373d01c7609efa7cd2c76726d` / tree `65ddf39cd37cad76d4ed9a313b71cd72afd12e8f`. This canonical promotion commit must independently pass exact-HEAD gates before state closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-698…DD-702 is the current governed backend-only AIConversation → optional AssistantDefinition → required PromptTemplate / optional ToolSet read-only evidence composition. It reuses DD-185 and DD-179 exact id/ACTIVE/scope-containment under the unchanged RequestContext.

Verified implementation basis `69e3b75b978b240373d01c7609efa7cd2c76726d` / tree `65ddf39cd37cad76d4ed9a313b71cd72afd12e8f`: **1695/1695 Core**, **540/540 PostgreSQL** with full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped Core or PostgreSQL tests.

Raw references are unchanged; no conversation history/content disclosure, owner currentness, cross-Industry carry, retention/erasure, effective Assistant/prompt/tool selection, prompt rendering, RAG/provider/model/tool/agent/inference execution, API/UI or mutation authority. Separate port reads are not atomic.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD698_DD702_VERIFICATION_2026-10-09.md`. Source audit: `Development/AI_CONVERSATION_ASSISTANT_PROMPT_TOOL_SET_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this DD-698…DD-702 canonical promotion HEAD independently across Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web; only after all pass, synchronize separate state closure.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Updated:** 2026-10-06 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.
