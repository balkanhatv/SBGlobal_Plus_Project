# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-MESSAGE-CONVERSATION-BINDING-FLOORS-001`
**Updated:** 2026-09-26 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

DD-199 implements only AIMessage → AIConversation exact conversation-id parent foreign-key continuity. Conversation authorization/currentness, assistant validity, content/source access, model-route authority and AI execution remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified DD-199 implementation basis `0fecb3a123caf56b4239fed7636f6c65ce624a13` / tree `06968170ab6fda5a8ed13fcc870ea02ac87c46ca`: **638/638 Core**, **504/504 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36166637126` (jobs `108175887608`, `108175887768`), Database `36166637151` (job `108175887696`), Web `36166637161` (job `108175887627`).

DD-199 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted in the current metadata change. The verified executable basis is the implementation HEAD above; this promotion HEAD must independently pass Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web before another DD/source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD199_VERIFICATION_2026-09-26.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this DD-199 canonical promotion HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Only after PASS, source-audit the next independent persisted AI relationship. Principal currentness remains blocked unless governing provenance changes.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

## Historical phase records

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Updated:** 2026-09-21 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.
