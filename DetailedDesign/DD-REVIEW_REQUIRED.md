# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-TOKEN-USAGE-CAPABILITY-CURRENT-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `5240e4b06c9ec798b1d36a5a1cd9436336c70eef` / tree `e7df7e43a1dc761c6c925bbd7c7678ea9797fdfe`
**Updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-10):** DD-713…DD-717 canonical promotion independently passed exact-HEAD Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. This separate state closure requires independent exact-HEAD Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web before DD-717 closes. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-713…DD-717 is the current governed backend-only scoped TokenUsage → exact global AICapability(code) persisted direct-FK relationship evidence composition. It reuses DD-197 UUID/code strict equality after the original DD-122 RequestContext/FORCE-RLS-scoped usage read and DD-109 exact global by-code lookup.

Verified independently promoted canonical basis `5240e4b06c9ec798b1d36a5a1cd9436336c70eef` / tree `e7df7e43a1dc761c6c925bbd7c7678ea9797fdfe`: **1719/1719 Core**, **540/540 PostgreSQL** with full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS, zero failed/skipped Core or PostgreSQL tests. Separate state closure is conditionally effective upon own exact-HEAD CI.

Raw scoped usage and global catalog source references, numeric precision and opaque metadata remain unchanged. No catalog currentness/eligibility, entitlement/policy, principal authorization, Tenant/Industry allowlisting, provider/model compatibility, pricing/billing, routing, AI inference/RAG/media/tool/agent, API/UI/mutation/events or atomic snapshot authority.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD713_DD717_VERIFICATION_2026-10-10.md`. Source audit: `Development/AI_TOKEN_USAGE_CAPABILITY_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Independently confirm this DD-713…DD-717 state-closure HEAD passed Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web; once green, close DD-717 and source-audit the next independently source-complete backend batch before development.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirement IDs**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP`. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Updated:** 2026-10-06 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.
