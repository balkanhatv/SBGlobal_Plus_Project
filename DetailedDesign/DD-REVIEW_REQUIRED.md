# DD REVIEW REQUIRED — PHASE 3 CLOSURE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-SYNC-CURSOR-CURRENT-BINDING-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `50f414f02baa645e9a30a92c58804a7ae090a312` / tree `267c7b7aae032dc72ccedd20e61a7152652a2c58`
**Updated:** 2026-10-05 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-05):** DD-498…DD-502 SyncCursor current-binding evidence is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-498…DD-502 is the current governed backend-only SyncCursor exact current-binding evidence composition. It reads one exact raw SyncCursor tuple, its exact same-context visible TenantIntegration and exact IntegrationCapability under the loaded parent Definition, then applies only the existing DD-164 necessary binding floor.

Verified canonical promotion basis `4dfd13190e037e10ca42cd04838c4545b84fc68d` / tree `857662ecb823933e9e983a7098bb1d9840db57b2`: **1343/1343 Core**, **532/532 PostgreSQL** plus full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

Cursor payload/watermark/sourceVersion/updatedAt plus TenantIntegration health/profile/config and Capability direction/OperationContract/event/data/rate/idempotency remain raw. Success adds no cursor-valid/fresh/resumable, DD-497 full persisted-integrity, provider/credential/secret, GuardPipeline/Commercial, sync/network/dispatch/mutation authority.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD498_DD502_VERIFICATION_2026-10-05.md`. Source audit: `Development/SYNC_CURSOR_CURRENT_BINDING_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this state-closure commit at its exact HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, DD-493…DD-497 is closed; source-audit the next independently source-complete backend batch.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Updated:** 2026-10-05 · **Historical checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Historical Phase-3 status:** CLOSED FOR DD; current dependencies below

## Historical Phase-3 result
- Open P0: **0**
- Open P1: **0**
- Open avoidable P2: **0**
- REAL_DD_GAP: **0**

## Phase-3 findings closed
- shared Config/Metadata/Rules/Form engine lifecycle and safe-expression boundary;
- Country/Localization Pack schema/activation;
- AI API/provisioning/memory/document/prompt/media contracts;
- exactly two Tenant mobile app classes;
- brand hierarchy/protected semantic-token floor;
- data access/export/portability;
- Future Industry promotion state machine;
- role-specific mobile wording in Industry DDs.

## Historical findings
Prior Fable 5 P0/P1/P2 findings and DD-F5-RECERTIFIED remain historical evidence. Their resolved contracts were freshly re-read and retained where still valid.

## Boundary
DD REVIEW_REQUIRED remains closed. The historical project-wide pre-development gate was later satisfied. Current database audit findings were concrete implementation/cross-layer propagation defects and are now owned by DD-036…039 and DBA-001…013; their runtime verdict belongs to the in-progress Database checkpoint, not a reopened whole-DD ambiguity gate.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.
