## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Implementation decisions are contiguous through **DD-079**; current Core/API/Commercial boundaries and runtime evidence are in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

Current provider/session validation, RBAC/ABAC, Commercial components and three first-party query bindings have executable coverage. VC-01–04 correct existing boundaries/evidence, and REPO-001–006 enforce repository invariants. Concrete DD-076 evaluator policy/evidence definitions and producer runtimes remain unfinished; the [prerequisite ownership audit](../Development/COMMERCIAL_EVALUATOR_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md) identifies those dependencies. Historical design completion does not certify full product or production readiness.


## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.


**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `20f1f5531a75a711bb88e013d38454f8c171e6b1` / tree `00aac681a7a33e8dc92c6dfb767283fcb544cdf9` — 283 Core tests, 65 PostgreSQL tests, full 47-migration/41-verification bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. The containing checkpoint commit must also pass its own exact-head CI. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_VISION_AUDIT_VERIFICATION_2026-09-21.md).
