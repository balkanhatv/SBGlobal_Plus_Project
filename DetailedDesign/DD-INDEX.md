## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-112**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-112 adds an exact-by-id owner-scoped `core_ai.ai_prompt_set` raw persistence reader through the existing `PostgresAIGatewayDatabase` + `RequestScopedSql` boundary. PLATFORM/TENANT/INDUSTRY ownership, raw code, positive version, constrained lifecycle status and timestamps remain persisted definition evidence only; they do not select an ACTIVE/current PromptSet, resolve members, select/render PromptTemplates, resolve IndustryAIConfig prompt binding or execute prompts. Existing schema-owned Tenant/Industry PromptSet DML privileges of `sbg_ai_gateway_rw` remain unchanged, while migration-0032 continues to protect PLATFORM PromptSet writes behind the control-plane role.

Workflow/Automation runtime execution and concrete AI Gateway execution remain unfinished on source-owned prerequisites. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure and DD-076 evaluator also remain unfinished where documented.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `14cf54776df8446f1a83c66c834421cf5119614c` / tree `b1163db6fc833ec5810bbb049da0bee6728f7a2e` — 311 Core tests, 224 PostgreSQL tests including `AIPROMPTSET-PG-001…007`, full 47/41 bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. Promotion invariant gate `7e4d5e18aabb8a2a8950ebb0eeba46ab6713bc19` / tree `4a8136c832137f604c032a4f8342da47b19fa1bf`: Core run `35817372068` (Core job `107041678390`, PostgreSQL job `107041678174`), Database run `35817372133` (job `107041678241`), Web run `35817372062` (job `107041678180`) — SUCCESS; invariants **9 Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 registered Industry tables / 2,962 preserved requirements / 112 unique DD definitions**. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD112_VERIFICATION_2026-09-23.md).
