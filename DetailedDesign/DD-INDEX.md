## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-119**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-119 adds an exact-by-id Tenant-scoped `core_ai.tenant_ai_config` raw persistence reader through the existing `PostgresAIGatewayDatabase` + `RequestScopedSql` boundary. Tenant FORCE-RLS, raw enablement, capability/provider/model allowlists, sensitivity ceiling, policy references, positive version and updated timestamp remain persisted configuration evidence only. The reader does not select latest/current/effective Tenant configuration, compile provisioning, evaluate eligibility/policy or route/execute AI. Existing migration-owned TenantAIConfig DML authority remains unchanged.

Workflow/Automation runtime execution and concrete AI Gateway execution remain unfinished on source-owned prerequisites. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure and DD-076 evaluator also remain unfinished where documented.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `20f7f4929eaef9a5eee23fd601efa35c44c35139` / tree `63685b07fb9ac60f63aa8b081130fb905e4b327b` — 311 Core tests, 273 PostgreSQL tests including `AITENCFG-PG-001…007`, full 47/41 bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. Promotion invariant gate `1ea88e19e17b1157a55133e3f6dbf7e5fe4c0360` / tree `02a7ea6d3a22e35a149f01f140d8d352345359fd`: Core run `35825278568` (Core job `107065518567`, PostgreSQL job `107065518916`), Database run `35825278683` (job `107065518957`), Web run `35825278656` (job `107065519027`) — SUCCESS; invariants **9 Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 registered Industry tables / 2,962 preserved requirements / 119 unique DD definitions**. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD119_VERIFICATION_2026-09-23.md).
