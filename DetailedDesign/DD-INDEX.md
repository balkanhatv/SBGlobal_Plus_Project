## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-080**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-080 adds an unmounted reusable external REST Fetch adapter: edge and credential/context checks precede body/input work, routes bind one OperationContract, the shared executor remains the only business/security pipeline, and DD-052 owns every success/error/control projection. No route, API-key syntax, OpenAPI document, webhook endpoint, database object or Commercial rule was invented.

Concrete external credential syntax, public REST route catalog/input mappings, OpenAPI publication, webhook transport, broad Core/Industry APIs, product UI/mobile/desktop and production operations remain unfinished. The concrete DD-076 evaluator and its named Commercial policy/evidence producers remain blocked.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.


**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `ce4708eec15f6b0a35ae9a77d13505221fe55d51` / tree `9655553773e2b1f63ba1e36a479ef3d574ec6077` — 290 Core tests, 65 PostgreSQL tests, full 47/41 bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD080_VERIFICATION_2026-09-21.md).
