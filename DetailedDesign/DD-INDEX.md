## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-131**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-131 adds an exact-by-id parent-scoped `core_ai.agent_step` raw persistence reader. Parent AgentRun FORCE-RLS remains authoritative. Raw step type/status/input/output/tool-binding/approval/audit references and timestamps remain persisted evidence only; they do not authorize next-step selection, approval satisfaction, current tool eligibility or execution.

Workflow/Automation runtime execution and concrete AI Gateway execution remain unfinished on source-owned prerequisites. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure and DD-076 evaluator also remain unfinished where documented.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** Verified executable `fddfc39252d89508d093633ec79a141739bf56d4` / tree `9758436cc7638963f40f5b45dbb3db7d1ce12f18`: **311/311 Core**, **357/357 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, Next.js build and Database Verify PASS. Promotion invariant gate `9f79d33f9d16f5ef9392fa1b1820a18f3a04973a` / tree `fe697622ea9d8119345f6b54d5e8359f3294d387`: Core run `35852604308` (Core `107153562830`, PostgreSQL `107153563110`), Database run `35852604292` (`107153563084`), Web run `35852604279` (`107153562758`) — SUCCESS; **131 unique DD definitions**, 9 Industries, 41 canonical MS, 181 Industry tables, 2,962 preserved requirements. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD131_VERIFICATION_2026-09-23.md).
