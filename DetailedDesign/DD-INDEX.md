## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-121**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-121 adds an exact-by-id owner-principal-scoped `core_ai.ai_conversation` raw persistence reader through the existing `PostgresAIGatewayDatabase` + `RequestScopedSql` boundary. Tenant/principal and exact-Industry FORCE-RLS, raw scope/sensitivity/retention/status and timestamp evidence remain persisted conversation metadata only. The reader does not load messages, aggregate/carry history, select/revalidate an Assistant, execute retention/erasure, route or perform inference. Existing migration-owned conversation DML authority remains unchanged.

Workflow/Automation runtime execution and concrete AI Gateway execution remain unfinished on source-owned prerequisites. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure and DD-076 evaluator also remain unfinished where documented.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `287fa3d06db72c49479b3615b296f32c9d3ea06d` / tree `2ff750905d8ce6bdb4f47befb81500e976483ce5` — 311 Core tests, 287 PostgreSQL tests including `AICONV-PG-001…007`, full 47/41 bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. Promotion invariant gate `713e82a6dbb313272ab3d85de8f0fe7cc82b7b95` / tree `c5edeb5f7aa6017ac9ea8f132c25563f5289386d`: Core run `35827411376` (Core job `107072092222`, PostgreSQL job `107072091951`), Database run `35827411348` (job `107072091699`), Web run `35827411353` (job `107072092327`) — SUCCESS; invariants **9 Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 registered Industry tables / 2,962 preserved requirements / 121 unique DD definitions**. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD121_VERIFICATION_2026-09-23.md).
