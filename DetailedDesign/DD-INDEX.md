## Historical design gate and current Development scope
**FOUNDATION PASS · ARCHITECTURE PASS · DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE / PHASE 3 PASS.**

The historical pre-development authorization gate was subsequently satisfied and Development started. Development remains **IN PROGRESS**. Decisions are contiguous through **DD-149**; current evidence is in [CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT](../Development/CORE_SERVICE_CHECKPOINT.md).

DD-149 adds migration 0029's deterministic OperatorElevation subject/target binding floor: exact operator principal + Tenant, Tenant-wide NULL Industry compatibility, and exact Industry matching when targeted. It remains a necessary predicate only and does not select, activate or authorize elevation.

Workflow/Automation runtime execution and concrete AI Gateway execution remain unfinished on source-owned prerequisites. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure and DD-076 evaluator also remain unfinished where documented.

## Historical all-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in [ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13](../Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md).
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

**Historical Development evidence:** `3e7b2927…` — 47 Core/server acceptance tests, 11 PostgreSQL tests, and 34 migrations / 28 verification files passed at that checkpoint.

**Current verified executable evidence:** `51c936d935bbe7ff3d7f575e58eee139c7fe92ea` / tree `342e128a09553780e5383a86d640090ff2fd1e4e` — 325 Core tests including `OPELEV-BIND-001…007`, 469 PostgreSQL tests, full 47/41 bootstrap, Database Verify and Next.js build PASS. Promotion invariant gate `3d7f96f4a7c2ec95efa6b31639bea0c05dde1d6a` / tree `8cd45ced033028fdaf814c94190e9cfc7923dd4b`: Core run `35913170548` (Core job `107357883015`, PostgreSQL job `107357883220`), Database run `35913170633` (job `107357883236`), Web run `35913170525` (job `107357883965`) — SUCCESS; **149 unique DD definitions**, 9 Industries, 41 canonical MS, 181 Industry tables, 2,962 preserved requirements. See [verification evidence](../Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD149_VERIFICATION_2026-09-23.md).

Post-promotion DD-145 fidelity correction `14b69ad4c66d78340c0bd020d65ff1f444b7c02c` / tree `35d7e5dafb39c53384f817cfba3a8d56ffd048ec`: Core run `35909155774` (job `107344302164`) **311/311**, PostgreSQL job `107344301757` **462/462** including corrected `APICRED-META-PG-004`, Database run `35909155819` (job `107344301870`) SUCCESS, Web run `35909155798` (job `107344301871`) SUCCESS. This changes only schema-valid nullable `allowed_cidrs` preservation; DD-146 checkpoint and OperatorElevation semantics are unchanged.
