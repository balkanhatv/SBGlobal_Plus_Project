# DD PHASE STATE
**Date:** 2026-09-22 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-AUTOMATION-RUN-READ-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-22

Current checkpoint: `DEV-AUTOMATION-RUN-READ-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-106. Historical Phase-3 completion applies to its evaluated scope.

Verified executable `0bd4cb33d07836f797d434b21d5e24fcee0a3641` / tree `e6630c0dc1d01b238e9299c6281cb3ce86ed76e6`: **311/311 Core**, **190/190 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, **Next.js build** and **Database Verify PASS**. Zero failed/skipped tests. Verified executable inventory: **526 blobs / 213 Markdown / 134 source / 77 test files**.

DD-106 adds an exact-by-id raw AutomationRun PostgreSQL reader through the dedicated Workflow worker/RLS boundary. Raw run evidence remains non-authorizing; it cannot decide trigger execution, replay, retry/finality, a next state or runtime mutation. Existing schema-owned Workflow worker AutomationRun UPDATE privilege remains unchanged outside the read-port surface.

Automation runtime execution remains unfinished. Workflow transition/state-machine/approval/rule execution, WorkflowInstance/task mutation and event emission remain unfinished. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure, DD-076 evaluator and concrete AI Gateway remain unfinished on their named prerequisites.

Next: Source-audit the next independent source-complete Workflow/Automation persistence slice. Do not open automation runtime execution semantics unless source-owned. Notification runtime, secret retrieval, webhook/event runtime, Document signing, REST exposure, DD-076 and concrete AI Gateway remain unfinished.
