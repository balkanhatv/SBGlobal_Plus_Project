# DD PHASE STATE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-NOTIFICATION-DELIVERY-SOURCE-EVENT-PAYLOAD-VALIDATED-READER-COMPOSITION-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `92b8cd67ba6a1e62937633beb7fd25f5da5cdb00` / tree `5c7197df074d33c138c695f0eeb932d5a66c84e0`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-01):** DD-348…DD-352 canonical promotion is exact-head verified at the basis above; this state-closure commit must independently pass before the next governed backend batch opens. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-338…DD-342 is the current governed backend-only NotificationDelivery source-event pre-payload structural evidence batch. It starts from exact DD-337 consumer-metadata evidence, re-evaluates strict occurredAt calendar validity plus payload/catalog-schema JSON structure, and returns immutable composed evidence without a new read or schema execution.

Verified canonical promotion basis `0c50e40ed9e96d6182c73c75777eb7bde142467b` / tree `c94826b15e51c2b0f6f54161dbefb51145973dfc`: **1085/1085 Core**, **529/529 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36891201425` (jobs `110466980221`, `110466980591`), Database `36891201601` (job `110466980585`), Web `36891201711` (job `110466981076`).

Frontend/UI remains untouched. EventPayloadValidator execution, JSON Schema semantics, EventCatalog lifecycle/consumer selection, webhook authorization, Outbox readiness/claim/retry/DLQ/replay, recipient currentness, provider/credential resolution, rendering, dispatch/send/callback reconciliation, mutation, historical residency reconstruction and EXPLICIT_CROSS_CONTEXT execution remain separately governed.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD338_DD342_VERIFICATION_2026-10-01.md`. Source audit: `Development/NOTIFICATION_DELIVERY_SOURCE_EVENT_PRE_PAYLOAD_STRUCTURE_EVIDENCE_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: this state-closure commit must independently pass exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, DD-338…DD-342 is closed and the next independently source-complete governed backend batch may be source-audited.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

## Historical phase records

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-PROVISIONING-VERSION-RAW-READ-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.
