# DD PHASE STATE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-TOOL-DEFINITION-CAPABILITY-BINDING-FLOORS-001`
**Updated:** 2026-09-26 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

DD-203 implements only AIToolDefinition → AICapability exact capability-code foreign-key continuity. Capability currentness/entitlement/policy, ToolDefinition permission/approval/OperationContract eligibility, ToolSet/AgentStep authorization, provider/model routing and AI/tool execution remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified DD-203 implementation basis `76491ca63a0101e1334f1800709e447a996d2523` / tree `b80b7794fe54c660c26f8694e1aa91df3f267d1b`: **664/664 Core**, **504/504 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36235041108` (jobs `108385158037`, `108385157885`), Database `36235041064` (job `108385157943`), Web `36235041093` (job `108385157930`).

DD-203 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted in the current metadata change. The verified executable basis is the implementation HEAD above; this promotion HEAD must independently pass Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web before another DD/source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD203_VERIFICATION_2026-09-26.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this DD-203 canonical promotion HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Only after PASS, source-audit the next independent persisted AI relationship; principal currentness and complete AI/tool execution remain locked.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

## Historical phase records

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-AI-TOOL-DEFINITION-CAPABILITY-BINDING-FLOORS-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
