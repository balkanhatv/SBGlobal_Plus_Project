# DD PHASE STATE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-SYNC-CURSOR-CURRENT-BINDING-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `50f414f02baa645e9a30a92c58804a7ae090a312` / tree `267c7b7aae032dc72ccedd20e61a7152652a2c58`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-05):** DD-498…DD-502 SyncCursor current-binding evidence is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-498…DD-502 is the current governed backend-only SyncCursor exact current-binding evidence composition. It reads one exact raw SyncCursor tuple, its exact same-context visible TenantIntegration and exact IntegrationCapability under the loaded parent Definition, then applies only the existing DD-164 necessary binding floor.

Verified exact-head implementation basis `50f414f02baa645e9a30a92c58804a7ae090a312` / tree `267c7b7aae032dc72ccedd20e61a7152652a2c58`: **1351/1351 Core**, **532/532 PostgreSQL** plus full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

Cursor payload/watermark/sourceVersion/updatedAt plus TenantIntegration health/profile/config and Capability direction/OperationContract/event/data/rate/idempotency remain raw. Success adds no cursor-valid/fresh/resumable, DD-497 full persisted-integrity, provider/credential/secret, GuardPipeline/Commercial, sync/network/dispatch/mutation authority.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD498_DD502_VERIFICATION_2026-10-05.md`. Source audit: `Development/SYNC_CURSOR_CURRENT_BINDING_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this canonical promotion at its exact HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, record promotion evidence and stage DD-498…DD-502 state closure before another source audit.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-PROVISIONING-VERSION-RAW-READ-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.
