# DD PHASE STATE
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-AGENT-APPROVAL-APPROVED-APPROVER-RBAC-CURRENT-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `95dfef25f9652ba042b52ca9ac7491b087abfe7d` / tree `3e42dbd743e44b9a6f1573a47b91320dbac7e7ba`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-04):** DD-433…DD-437 AgentApproval persisted-APPROVED + trusted approver-context + current RBAC necessary-evidence composition is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-428…DD-432 is the current governed backend-only AgentApproval-first persisted-APPROVED + trusted approver-context current-evidence composition. It reuses exact DD-427 approval-parent evidence first, requires an explicitly supplied already-trusted approver RequestContext, and re-applies DD-419 exact approver principal/Tenant/nullable-Industry continuity without constructing or re-resolving context.

Verified canonical promotion basis `3df3bfdc3bb55eb6930463ec24ea71e34f647571` / tree `ee65d77e72d916b0f58d47330a1f8ba007d2ffed`: **1235/1235 Core**, **532/532 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

AgentApproval requiredPermission/type/status/history plus AgentRun/AgentStep lifecycle and backlink state remain raw evidence. Success means only persisted APPROVED plus recorded approver identity matching an explicitly supplied already-trusted current Tenant/Industry RequestContext. No RequestContext synthesis, current permission decision, approval-satisfaction, GuardPipeline/commercial admission, AgentRun transition, dispatch, mutation/event, provider/model routing or AI/tool execution is introduced. Frontend/UI remains untouched.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD428_DD432_VERIFICATION_2026-10-03.md`. Source audit: `Development/AI_AGENT_APPROVAL_APPROVED_APPROVER_CONTEXT_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this state-closure commit at its exact HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, DD-428…DD-432 is closed; source-audit the next independently source-complete backend batch.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.
