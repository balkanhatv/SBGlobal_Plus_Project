# DD PHASE STATE
**Date:** 2026-09-23 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-API-CREDENTIAL-METADATA-READ-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-23

Current checkpoint: `DEV-API-CREDENTIAL-METADATA-READ-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-145.

Verified executable `031b4068685172f5a9c6c461f5ab73e237737e27` / tree `8c8a9a4c21653e7ef4d5962eaac23bdd7412acb8`: **311/311 Core**, **455/455 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, Next.js build and Database Verify PASS. Zero failed/skipped tests.

Promotion invariant gate `c06225eeeee9b203afafb2359d31a831408abbd0` / tree `3e07ac1bdb823753a849e79a2503dd687ee2c8d6`: Core run `35906282606` (Core job `107334685860`, PostgreSQL job `107334686239`), Database run `35906282548` (job `107334685959`), Web run `35906282562` (job `107334685244`) — SUCCESS; **145 unique DD definitions**, 9 Industries, 41 canonical MS, 181 Industry tables, 2,962 preserved requirements.

DD-145 adds an exact metadata-only `core_identity.api_credential` reader through the fixed pre-context Identity-service role. `secret_hash` is excluded; raw physical scope/status/CIDR/allowed-Industry/timestamp evidence and exact signed bigint credential version remain non-authorizing persistence facts.

Next: Fresh source-audit the next independent source-complete Core persistence slice. Keep machine credential verification/token parsing/hash comparison, CIDR enforcement, lifecycle usability, credential mutation/use-audit, RequestContext authorization and operator-elevation behavior outside scope unless separately source-owned.
