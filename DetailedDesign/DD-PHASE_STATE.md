**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-MESSAGE-CONVERSATION-ASSISTANT-CURRENT-EVIDENCE-READER-001`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-09):** DD-693…DD-697 implementation passed exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web at `81df89fab16cd217628f944e2b8d04db9dc4a6f1` / tree `75e1c64cecc84c3751a842e99c9f7506a779b5b5`. This canonical promotion commit requires independent exact-HEAD gates and separate state-closure verification. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-688…DD-692 is the current governed backend-only exact AICost → TokenUsage direct-binding evidence reader. It loads one scoped cost and its exact persisted usage parent under identical RequestContext using existing DD-198 UUID/FK equality floors.

Verified canonical promotion basis `84dc51e5fec0069466ef298e80cf068b018bfca1` / tree `dfdaed2478e29dc1eaf30a48806a987cded0f891`: **1675/1675 Core**, **540/540 PostgreSQL** plus full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

Success preserves exact raw cost and usage evidence only; no pricing/rate/billability, currency conversion, finalization, invoice/tax/payment/ledger, quota/budget, current principal/catalog, or AI execution authority.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD688_DD692_VERIFICATION_2026-10-09.md`. Source audit: `Development/AI_COST_TOKEN_USAGE_CURRENT_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Source-audit the next independent backend batch only after this DD-688…DD-692 state-closure commit independently passes exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-PROVISIONING-VERSION-RAW-READ-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.
