# DD PHASE STATE
**Date:** 2026-09-24 · **Historical DD checkpoint:** `PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED` · **Current Development overlay:** `DEV-OPERATOR-ELEVATION-RELATIONSHIP-INTEGRITY-001`

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-24

Current checkpoint: `DEV-OPERATOR-ELEVATION-RELATIONSHIP-INTEGRITY-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-154.

Verified executable `d2c8d9598401859541b72383d78bd6bb633c1b80` / tree `848b24f36d08710d6a378900ba36456c429e3d6d`: **346/346 Core**, **483/483 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, Next.js build and Database Verify PASS. Zero failed/skipped tests.

Post-promotion DD-145 fidelity correction `14b69ad4c66d78340c0bd020d65ff1f444b7c02c` / tree `35d7e5dafb39c53384f817cfba3a8d56ffd048ec`: Core run `35909155774` (job `107344302164`) **311/311**, PostgreSQL job `107344301757` **462/462** including corrected `APICRED-META-PG-004`, Database run `35909155819` (job `107344301870`) SUCCESS, Web run `35909155798` (job `107344301871`) SUCCESS. This changes only schema-valid nullable `allowed_cidrs` preservation; DD-146 checkpoint and OperatorElevation semantics are unchanged.

Promotion invariant gate `aa23b2f9c42aca61dad47483778369e0e1aa8cba` / tree `3afc27e882f4e76238edd88bef7448f133a0cc49`: Core run `35946118505` (Core job `107464316684`, PostgreSQL job `107464316811`), Database run `35946118591` (job `107464317181`), Web run `35946118597` (job `107464317184`) — SUCCESS; **154 unique DD definitions**, 9 Industries, 41 canonical MS, 181 Industry tables, 2,962 preserved requirements.

DD-150 adds only the verified interactive PLATFORM_OPERATOR identity necessary floor. HUMAN/API_CLIENT/SERVICE fail even with matching principal id; auth/session/device/provider metadata is not interpreted as step-up or elevation policy.

Next: Fresh source-audit the next runtime prerequisite. Keep trusted elevation-id selection, explicit DD-148/DD-149/DD-150 composition, step-up policy, permission-profile evaluation, approval/purpose policy, RequestContext/SQL elevation injection and mandatory audit outside scope unless separately source-owned.
