> **Current audit gate (2026-10-05):** DD-528…DD-532 Webhook source-event payload-validation evidence is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-528…DD-532 is the current governed backend-only WebhookDelivery source-event payload-validation evidence composition. It re-establishes exact DD-527 pre-payload evidence, projects only exact DD-081 TENANT_CORE/TENANT_INDUSTRY persistence-binding facts, and delegates the exact persisted envelope/catalog to the existing EventEnvelopeCatalogValidator with an injected EventPayloadValidatorPort.

Verified exact-head implementation basis `ceb85e10f71b20fa12c2b36b24220eb4a3695aee` / tree `8ee4fb5f6eedd0cf690051f662bce8220e2c8fb9`: **1403/1403 Core**, **536/536 PostgreSQL** plus full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

Success proves only that existing DD-081 envelope/catalog/binding validation accepted the exact persisted Webhook source event and the injected payload validator completed successfully. EventCatalog lifecycle, event-filter matching, endpoint/SSRF authorization, signing/secrets, readiness/retry/finality/DLQ/replay, EXPLICIT_CROSS_CONTEXT authorization, network dispatch and mutation remain raw or separately governed.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD528_DD532_VERIFICATION_2026-10-05.md`. Source audit: `Development/WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_EVENT_PAYLOAD_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this canonical promotion at its exact HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, record promotion evidence and stage DD-528…DD-532 state closure before another source audit.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

The following evidence retains its original baseline and does not override the current checkpoint above.

- Foundation: **FRESH RECONCILED — PASS**.
- Architecture: **FRESH REVALIDATED — PASS**.
- DD Wave 1 shared contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 2 platform contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- DD Wave 3 Industry/MS contracts: **FRESH REVALIDATED / VERIFIED**.
- Detailed Design: **COMPLETE — PHASE 3 PASS**.
- Final substantive DD HEAD: `b4bba9c4764025af3d4546644f7c67efa463c86d`.
- Phase-3 evidence: `Registers/PHASE3_DETAILED_DESIGN_REVALIDATION_2026-09-13.md`.
- DD final audits: DD-20D PASS · DD-29 REAL_DD_GAP=0 · DD-30 traceability PASS · DD-31 Development/QA 9/9 YES + 9/9 YES.
- Historical `DD-F5-RECERTIFIED` remains provenance only.
- Historical Phase-3 boundary: project-wide Development was not yet authorized at that checkpoint; the later pre-development gate and `UD-BACKUP-01` subsequently authorized Development to begin.
