**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-24

Current checkpoint: `DEV-TENANT-INTEGRATION-CURRENT-INTEGRITY-FLOORS-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-167.

Verified canonical DD-167 promotion `ecf694f8bf62082b2d59905591a97b237b866b8b` / tree `dc96af06648f79a606ce5ea24254e52f716c7f94`: **423/423 Core**, **497/497 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS. Exact-head runs: Core `35963182069` (Core job `107515946043`, PostgreSQL job `107515945847`), Database `35963181908` (job `107515945257`), Web `35963181936` (job `107515945440`).

DD-167 composes only the already-owned DD-165 credential current-binding floor and DD-166 Definition/config/enabled-capability current-set floor for the same TenantIntegration evidence. No new primitive predicate, fallback or precedence is introduced.

A true result is not TenantIntegration lifecycle/execution, provider selection, secret access, permission-profile resolution, callback/sync, OperationContract/event or network authority.

DD-162 machine verification, DD-163 Webhook execution and DD-164 SyncCursor runtime boundaries remain locked. DD-167 also leaves TenantIntegration lifecycle/health/profile/provider/secret/network semantics unclaimed.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD167_VERIFICATION_2026-09-24.md`.

Next: source-audit another independent prerequisite only where governing source owns deterministic behavior and executable acceptance.
