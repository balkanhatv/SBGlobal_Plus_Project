# DD CHECKPOINT — PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-WEBHOOK-DELIVERY-EVENT-CURRENT-RESIDENCY-EVIDENCE-READER-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `20721fa96b30321d4bb049033a5e46bd91a51541` / tree `6e3dcdd3799a37a5cf49af3cdcd908e7c926894a`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-05):** DD-518…DD-522 corrected Webhook source-event current Tenant residency evidence is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-518…DD-522 is the current governed backend-only WebhookDelivery source-event current Tenant residency evidence composition. It reuses exact DD-517 evidence, performs one exact Integration-owned current Tenant residency read under the existing Integration-service RLS boundary, and applies the shared current-residency equality floor while preserving explicit persisted envelope evidence.

Verified corrected implementation basis `20721fa96b30321d4bb049033a5e46bd91a51541` / tree `6e3dcdd3799a37a5cf49af3cdcd908e7c926894a`: **1387/1387 Core**, **536/536 PostgreSQL** plus full bootstrap, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests.

Delivery status/attempt/HTTP/error/timing, historical write-time residency, payload-schema/catalog lifecycle, Subscription filter/endpoint/secret metadata, retry/DLQ/replay, EXPLICIT_CROSS_CONTEXT and network dispatch remain raw or separately governed. Success proves only current authoritative Tenant residency equality over exact DD-517 evidence; it adds no delivery authorization, GuardPipeline/Commercial, mutation or event authority.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD518_DD522_VERIFICATION_2026-10-05.md`. Source audit: `Development/WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_EVENT_CURRENT_RESIDENCY_EVIDENCE_READER_COMPOSITION_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this canonical promotion at its exact HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, record promotion evidence and stage DD-518…DD-522 state closure before another source audit.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
