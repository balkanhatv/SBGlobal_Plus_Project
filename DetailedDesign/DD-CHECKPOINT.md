**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started in the Database phase. The current zero-trust audit has propagated database findings into DD-036…039/DBA-001…013; this does not reopen the whole completed DD phase, but exact-head database runtime evidence is verified at the bounded current checkpoint.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-21

Current checkpoint: `DEV-SYNC-CURSOR-READ-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-097. Historical Phase-3 completion applies to its evaluated scope.

Verified executable `9271010240d06eac21dbf750172b4a987a9dddb7` / tree `f4b0375255740ca3a94243d120beac4e94d21f6f`: **311/311 Core**, **131/131 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files bootstrap**, **Next.js build** and **Database Verify PASS**. Zero failed/skipped tests. Verified executable inventory: **480 blobs / 196 Markdown / 114 source / 68 test files**.

DD-097 adds an exact raw SyncCursor PostgreSQL reader through the fixed Integration service role + RequestScopedSql. It reads only the unique TenantIntegration + capability + nullable Industry Context tuple, preserves opaque/encrypted cursor, watermark/source-version and updated-at evidence, and relies on parent TenantIntegration FORCE-RLS for isolation. It deliberately does not decode/decrypt cursor data or decide sync resume/execution.

Full DD-08 signed access remains blocked on exact operation/permission, policy-specific step-up/residency and signer TTL/provider bindings. REST exposure, DD-076 evaluator, concrete AI Gateway, event dispatch/webhooks, broad Core/Industry APIs, product UI/mobile/desktop and production operations remain unfinished.

Next: Source-audit NotificationDelivery raw persistence as the next independent source-complete Core slice. Notification send/provider/retry decisions, CredentialReference secret retrieval, ProviderAdapter runtime selection/execution, TenantIntegration enablement/health decisions, webhook network/signing/filter/retry runtime, event dispatch mutation/retry/DLQ, Document policy/signing, REST exposure, DD-076 evaluator and concrete AI Gateway remain unfinished on their named prerequisites.
