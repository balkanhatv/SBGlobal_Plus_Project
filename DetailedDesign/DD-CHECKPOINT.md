**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started in the Database phase. The current zero-trust audit has propagated database findings into DD-036…039/DBA-001…013; this does not reopen the whole completed DD phase, but exact-head database runtime evidence is verified at the bounded current checkpoint.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-21

Current checkpoint: `DEV-DOCUMENT-ACL-READ-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-084. Historical Phase-3 completion applies to its evaluated scope.

Verified executable `176a96b28b24207b6aae8c38a82c7b03326164fd` / tree `6368798edb96e81e3b721d7d9bfe754f4ab60a74`: **305/305 Core**, **74/74 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files bootstrap**, **Next.js build** and **Database Verify PASS**. Zero failed/skipped tests. Verified executable inventory: **427 blobs / 170 Markdown / 89 source / 66 test files**.

DD-084 adds a raw Document ACL persistence boundary: typed ACL entries are read through the existing dedicated Document PostgreSQL/FORCE-RLS path in deterministic order, preserving persisted subject/permission/effect/expiry evidence without deciding authorization. No deny reducer, subject matcher, operation→ACL mapping, signer, route, SQL or privilege change was invented.

Full DD-08 signed access remains blocked on exact operation/permission, policy-specific step-up/residency and signer TTL/provider bindings. REST exposure, DD-076 evaluator, concrete AI Gateway, event dispatch/webhooks, broad Core/Industry APIs, product UI/mobile/desktop and production operations remain unfinished.

Next: Full Document signed access remains blocked on exact operation→Document permission/ACL mapping, final ACL fallback/deny evaluation semantics, policy-specific step-up/residency composition and concrete signed-grant TTL/provider signing. REST exposure, DD-076 evaluator, concrete AI Gateway, event dispatcher/retry/DLQ and webhook transport remain separate unfinished governed scopes. Source-audit the next independent source-complete slice before implementation.
