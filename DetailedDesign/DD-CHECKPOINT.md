# DD CHECKPOINT — PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-NOTIFICATION-DELIVERY-SOURCE-EVENT-PRE-PAYLOAD-STRUCTURE-EVIDENCE-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `68e8e0fe2b14effe492bade508e9a877cfbf783c` / tree `ac6fed6f137e677c12d188007b53e063f336e8ec`
**Updated:** 2026-10-01 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **Current audit gate (2026-10-01):** DD-338…DD-342 NotificationDelivery source-event pre-payload structural evidence batch is implemented and exact-head verified at the basis above. This canonical promotion must independently pass before batch closure. Complete-project downstream audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

DD-338…DD-342 is the current governed backend-only NotificationDelivery source-event pre-payload structural evidence batch. It starts from exact DD-337 consumer-metadata evidence, re-evaluates strict occurredAt calendar validity plus payload/catalog-schema JSON structure, and returns immutable composed evidence without a new read or schema execution.

Verified implementation basis `68e8e0fe2b14effe492bade508e9a877cfbf783c` / tree `ac6fed6f137e677c12d188007b53e063f336e8ec`: **1085/1085 Core**, **529/529 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36890468714` (jobs `110464508526`, `110464508879`), Database `36890468659` (job `110464508197`), Web `36890468664` (job `110464508256`).

Frontend/UI remains untouched. EventPayloadValidator execution, JSON Schema semantics, EventCatalog lifecycle/consumer selection, webhook authorization, Outbox readiness/claim/retry/DLQ/replay, recipient currentness, provider/credential resolution, rendering, dispatch/send/callback reconciliation, mutation, historical residency reconstruction and EXPLICIT_CROSS_CONTEXT execution remain separately governed.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD338_DD342_VERIFICATION_2026-10-01.md`. Source audit: `Development/NOTIFICATION_DELIVERY_SOURCE_EVENT_PRE_PAYLOAD_STRUCTURE_EVIDENCE_BATCH_PREREQUISITE_OWNERSHIP_AUDIT.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: this canonical promotion must independently pass exact-head Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Once green, record promotion evidence and close DD-338…DD-342 before opening the next independently source-complete governed backend batch.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
