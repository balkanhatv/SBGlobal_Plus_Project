**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**  
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started in the Database phase. The current zero-trust audit has propagated database findings into DD-036…039/DBA-001…013; this does not reopen the whole completed DD phase, but exact-head database runtime evidence is verified at the bounded current checkpoint.


## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The workflow log asserts the tested branch commit; the completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
Earlier Phase-3 labels describe their recorded baseline. Current source-owner reconciliation and the full-file audit supersede inherited traceability/count assumptions without changing the preserved source IDs.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-21
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-COMMERCIAL-INITIAL-ASSESSMENT-001`  
**Verified feature executable:** `bdc4f65c7d1f84e5b29e15c7b5dbfb8550c1ca11` / `8854a68a3fdd102ec06159b6da24864f5f42c32e`

Historical Phase-3 DD completion remains preserved. Current implementation decisions now extend contiguously through **DD-076**. DD-076 establishes the server-owned initial-assessment preparation seam after DD-075 and prevents known DD-073 blocking usage from disappearing from assessment blockers.

Feature evidence: Core **254/254**, PostgreSQL **56/56 + full 46/40 DB bootstrap**, Next.js build **PASS**, Database Verify **PASS**. No DD-076 database migration or privilege change occurred.

Concrete blocking-code/diff/fingerprint/dual-route semantics and DD-066 assessment-write orchestration remain unfinished. Next governed dependency is persisted DD-066 evidence consumption for a bounded internal DD-065 apply-evidence gate.
