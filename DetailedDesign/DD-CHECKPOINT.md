**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.

## Current Development overlay — 2026-09-23

Current checkpoint: `DEV-OPERATOR-ELEVATION-METADATA-READ-001`. Decisions are contiguous through DD-146.

Verified executable `14b69ad4c66d78340c0bd020d65ff1f444b7c02c` / tree `35d7e5dafb39c53384f817cfba3a8d56ffd048ec`: **311/311 Core**, **462/462 PostgreSQL**, **47 migrations / 41 SQL verification files**, Next.js build and Database Verify PASS. Zero failed/skipped tests.

Post-promotion DD-145 fidelity correction `14b69ad4c66d78340c0bd020d65ff1f444b7c02c` / tree `35d7e5dafb39c53384f817cfba3a8d56ffd048ec`: Core run `35909155774` (job `107344302164`) **311/311**, PostgreSQL job `107344301757` **462/462** including corrected `APICRED-META-PG-004`, Database run `35909155819` (job `107344301870`) SUCCESS, Web run `35909155798` (job `107344301871`) SUCCESS. This changes only schema-valid nullable `allowed_cidrs` preservation; DD-146 checkpoint and OperatorElevation semantics are unchanged.

Promotion invariant gate `0da4a8063f21b177df8de241e4080fbddc1d1dd8` / tree `9b8428bda8cb10b970df0e890b48443d9084eb1d`: Core run `35908101390` (Core job `107340749188`, PostgreSQL job `107340749373`), Database run `35908101578` (job `107340750340`), Web run `35908101452` (job `107340749629`) — SUCCESS; **146 unique DD definitions**, 9 Industries, 41 canonical MS, 181 Industry tables, 2,962 preserved requirements.

DD-146 adds an exact `core_authz.operator_elevation` metadata reader through a fixed `sbg_control_plane_rw` database boundary. Raw operator/Tenant/optional Industry/purpose/ticket/approval/status/permission-profile/time evidence remains Control Plane persistence metadata only. Normal `RequestScopedSql` continues to leave `app.operator_elevation_id` unset, so DD-146 does not activate elevation or grant Tenant/Industry access.

Next: Fresh source-audit the next runtime prerequisite. Keep trusted elevation selection, interactive PLATFORM_OPERATOR binding, approval/purpose policy, permission-profile evaluation, revocation/expiry race handling, RequestContext injection, transaction-local elevation scope and mandatory audit outside scope unless separately source-owned.
