# DD CHECKPOINT — PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-INDUSTRY-CONTEXT-ACTIVATION-RAW-READ-001`
**Current executable audit basis:** `4dd7138e5a546f608fe5e28e0912d17523e33693` / tree `33ea828f05b2b8014b4c75401822cde89aa3ee70`
**Updated:** 2026-09-28 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **Current audit gate (2026-09-28):** complete-project downstream semantic/file-coverage/adversarial audit remains **CLEAN / CLOSED** through VC27-111 with open current-scope P0/P1 = 0. DD-214 is implemented and exact-head verified; canonical promotion is pending its own exact-head gate. Production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.


DD-214 adds only an exact `(tenantId, industryContextId)` raw IndustryContext activation evidence reader returning id/Tenant/raw status/exact bigint activationVersion through the existing SELECT-only context-bootstrap boundary. Snapshot activation-version equality and all authorization/runtime semantics remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified DD-214 implementation basis `95f2d2a995bb9e08b15a750cd9ee33f540907afc` / tree `476d6b7248e763e38d764cff5b930a9ec66e5e42`: **781/781 Core**, **518/518 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36408356074` (jobs `108882368829`, `108882369182`), Database `36408356050` (job `108882368928`), Web `36408356201` (job `108882369979`).

DD-214 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted in the current metadata change. The verified implementation basis is the HEAD above; this promotion HEAD must independently pass Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web before another source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD214_VERIFICATION_2026-09-28.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: verify this DD-214 canonical promotion HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Only after PASS, close DD-214 state and source-audit ProvisioningSnapshot Industry-scoped activation-version equality using the newly verified raw evidence reader.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
