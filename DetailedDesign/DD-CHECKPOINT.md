# DD CHECKPOINT — PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED
**Current checkpoint:** `DEV-AI-TENANT-CONFIG-MODEL-ALLOWLIST-FLOORS-001`
**Updated:** 2026-09-26 · **Branch:** `docs/architecture-branch-2`

> **2026-09-26 audit hold:** VC26-01/02 corrections are exact-HEAD verified at `0da6d173679c31e202d4a0bf59ef3b8889a81404` (700 Core / 505 PostgreSQL / Database and Web PASS). Full semantic audit coverage is incomplete. Earlier continuation instructions below are on hold. Next: verify this evidence/state closure, then finish the remaining audit; do not open forward development. [Audit evidence](../Registers/VISION_CENTRIC_AUDIT_2026-09-26.md).


DD-208 implements only TenantAIConfig allowedModelIds[] duplicate-free exact-id/raw-ACTIVE AIModel binding plus exact Model providerId membership in the same config allowedProviderIds[]. Provider-row runtime suitability, effective Tenant+Industry configuration, routing and AI execution remain outside this checkpoint.

Verified canonical DD-208 promotion `c7825bedc7e96b5010266a42c710e36086728bca` / tree `8b87deba28541da36bd4c94d9559f91121a0aae2`: **700/700 Core**, **504/504 PostgreSQL**, **48 migrations / 42 SQL verification files**, Database/Web PASS; zero failed/skipped tests. Exact-head runs: Core `36256149589` (jobs `108443203216`, `108443203364`), Database `36256149596` (job `108443203187`), Web `36256149585` (job `108443203157`).

DD-208 decision/acceptance/traceability are canonically promoted and the promotion HEAD is exact-head verified. This state-closure commit must pass its own Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web gate before another DD/source audit opens.

Evidence: `Registers/DEVELOPMENT_DD208_VERIFICATION_2026-09-26.md`. Current status is bounded Development **IN PROGRESS**; production readiness is **NOT CLAIMED**.

Next: Verify this DD-208 state-closure HEAD with Core/PostgreSQL/Database/Web. Only after PASS, source-audit the next independent Tenant/Industry AI configuration relationship; effective configuration and AI execution remain locked.

Invariants: **9 equal Industries / 41 canonical MS / 181 Industry tables / 2,962 preserved source requirements**; exactly `TENANT_STAFF_APP` and `TENANT_USER_APP` as logical Tenant mobile app classes. RawSource unchanged; `main` unmerged; PR #2 draft/unmerged.

**Checkpoint: PHASE3-DD-REVALIDATED**
**DETAILED DESIGN COMPLETE · HISTORICAL PHASE-3 GATE SATISFIED.**

That historical overall-Development block was later closed by the final pre-development audit plus `UD-BACKUP-01`. Development has since started; current exact-head runtime evidence is verified at the bounded Development checkpoint below.

## All-stages checkpoint evidence
PostgreSQL+pgvector PASS: commit `2c36b43a7d55c6600b71f9714389e025a06df580`, Database Verify run `34800144921`, job `103841023234`. All 32 migrations and 26 verification files executed, including 0099. The completed all-stages audit and metadata closure are recorded in `Registers/ALL_STAGES_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT_2026-09-13.md`.
